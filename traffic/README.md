The number of layers and the types of layers you include in between are up to you. You may wish to experiment with:
-different numbers of convolutional and pooling layers
-different numbers and sizes of filters for convolutional layers
-different pool sizes for pooling layers
-different numbers and sizes of hidden layers
-dropout

Tried the one in the notes, with loss of 0.7091 and accuracy of 0.0060

Added another MAX-pooling layer: accuracy improved to 0.7850

Added another hidden layer: accuracy improved to 0.8290

Added another convolutional layer: accuracy improved to 0.9038

Doubled number of filters to 64 in second convolutional layer: accuracy improved to 0.9776

Looks good.
